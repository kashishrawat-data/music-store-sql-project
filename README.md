# 🎵 Music Store SQL Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a digital music store database using PostgreSQL.

The objective was to solve business-driven SQL problems ranging from basic aggregations to advanced analytical queries using joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.

The project is structured into three difficulty levels:

- Easy
- Moderate
- Advanced

4. Which city generates the highest total revenue?
5. Who is the best customer (highest total spending)?

### 🔎 Concepts Used:
- SELECT
- ORDER BY
- GROUP BY
- COUNT()
- SUM()
- LIMIT
- Basic JOIN
